## Omnifood

This project is a clone of the Omnifood webpage, created as part of my learning journey through the Udemy course [Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) by Jonas Schmedtmann. The goal of this project was to solidify my understanding of HTML and CSS, while also building a fully responsive webpage.

### Features:

- Responsive Design: The webpage is fully responsive and adjusts seamlessly across different screen sizes and devices.
- HTML & CSS: Built using modern HTML and CSS techniques, following best practices learned during the course.

### About the Project:

This project was developed as a hands-on exercise during the Udemy course, where I learned essential web development skills such as:

- HTML structure
- CSS styling
- Responsive design using media queries
